{-| A multiway tree or rosetree is a labeled tree where each node can have zero,
one or more children, each of which represents a tree in its own right.

The root of the tree is always labeled, so a tree always has at least one label.

As an example, such a structure could represent a directory structure:

    tree "root"
        [ tree "home"
            [ tree "user1" []
            , tree "user2" []
            ]
        , tree "etc" []
        , tree "var"
            [ tree "log" []
            ]
        ]

In a sense, `Html msg` is pretty similar to how such trees look, but they can be
used to represent other things. A nested menu structure, or a sitemap, or any
other structure where a single root is connected to children which can each have
children of their own, and so on.

# Advanced: Generic traversals

These functions have highly complex type signatures, but they abstract very
generic ways of working with trees and in fact nearly all the other functions
in this library are built using them. In general it is better to prefer the simpler
interfaces, but there are situations that may not be covered by other functions
in this library, where these more powerful functions can come in handy.

Note that all the callbacks passed receive four arguments:

  - the `state` variable that is accumulated throughout the whole computation
  - a list of `ancestors`, that is all the labels that lie above the current node
  - the current `label` of the node being processed
  - its `children`

I like to call these `\s a l c`, since "salc" is nice and pronouncable and quite
easy to remember.

You may want to read the source of this module for inspiration on how to use these
functions.

{-| Create a tree from a seed.

Running the function on the seed should return a label and a list of seeds to
use for the children.

For example, this function takes and int, and uses the string representation of
that int as the label, with its children representing the integers from 0 up to
but not including the value. The expected result is a tree in which each label
has the number of children mentioned in the label, recursively.

    type MyTree a = MyTree a (List (MyTree a))


    tree "root"
        [ tree "folder"
            [ singleton "foo"
            , singleton "bar"
            ]
        , singleton "yeah"
        ]
        |> restructure identity MyTree
    --> MyTree "root"
    -->     [ MyTree "folder"
    -->         [ MyTree "foo" []
    -->         , MyTree "bar" []
    -->         ]
    -->     , MyTree "yeah" []
    -->     ]

{-| The first callback to this function is used when going down the tree, effectively guiding and transforming it.
The second callback is used to reconstruct the tree when going back up.

This is similar like `restructure`, except this function:

  - has an accumulator argument
  - the first function can also change the children, not just the label (this allows us to implement `unfold` in terms of this function for instance)
